* wifi

  This is a fork of the default stumpwm wifi package.  It depends on
  iw tool to actually query the state of the wireless device.

** usage

   First load the plugin in your configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :stumpwm.contrib.wifi)
#+END_SRC

   Then you can use "%I" to show your signal strength and SSID of the
   station.  You can also use "%i" if you just want to show the just
   the signal strength.
